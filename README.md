its a game that supports mac and linux too all you need is java.

its an avoider game, the conept was to design/program somthing fast
that has simple mechanics i can build upon (start simple and add complexity, but stay a simple game).
also its tile based so i can create alot of levels, or even let somone else create levels(without programming).
 i thoght of somthing like sokaban but more complex, but still simple.
(i have an implementation of sokaban i will upload it shortly after this).

in the postmortom i will fix some of the bugs and make the levels text files intead of arrays.

this game uses my game framework for slick2d:
